<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

## Thoughts 

This is straightforward. We can calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the value of 4 million. Then, we can sum all even numbers in the sequence.

## R

### Answer 1

```{r}
y <- c(1, 2)
while (rev(y)[1] < 4e6) {
  y <- c(y, sum(rev(y)[1:2]))
}
sum(y[y %% 2 == 0])
```
