The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385.$$
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025.$$
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
