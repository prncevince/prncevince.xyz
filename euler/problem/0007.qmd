By listing the first six prime numbers: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13$, we can see that the 6th prime is $13$.

What is the $10,001$st prime number?

## Development

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is important here. Resource:

- <https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/sieve-of-eratosthenes.html>

It is said that $n * ln(n)$ is a good ***estimate*** of the $n$^th^ prime.

Thus, we implement the logic below as a crude implementation of the sieve where we pre-generate values, setting our upper bound to $2 * n * ln(n)$ where $n$ is the $n$^th^ prime.

In the sieve, we eliminate each prime incrementally from the pre-generated set until we reach the $n$^th^ prime. We do this by checking divisibility by the lowest prime of 2, then 3, 5, 7, etc.

## R

### Answer 1

```{r}
n <- 10001

sieve <- function(n) {
  n1 <- 2
  n2 <- 2*ceiling(n*log(n))
  p <- n1:n2
  for(i in 2:n) {
    # incremental elimination
    p <- p[p %% p[1] != 0]
  }
  return(c(p[1], max=n2))
}

tic()
sieve(n)
toc()
```

### Answer 2

```{r}
primes::nth_prime(10001)
```
